# Baronzr JS Library

Baronzr is an artificial JS scroll bar that could be easily styled in the days when that was impossible. Today, most browser support [meaningul](https://caniuse.com/?search=scrollbar) styling capabilities for scrollbars. 

This project contains a dated approach to style-able scrollbars in web interfaces. The main trigger for the project were the ugly scrollbars of UWP apps, based on the behavior of Internet Explorer. There is direct dependency on  jQuery and no bundlers are used.
