# An artificial JS scroll bar that can be easily styled

This project contains a dated approach to style-able scrollbars in web interfaces. The main trigger for the project were the ugly scrollbars of UWP apps, based on the behavior of Internet Explorer. There is direct dependency on  jQuery and no bundlers are used.
